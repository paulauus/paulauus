### Hi there! üëã

I‚Äôm passionate about everything data. My work spans across software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning, with a focus on delivering high-performance solutions for complex problems.

#### What I Love Working On:
- **Data Engineering:** Designing and building scalable ETL pipelines, stream processing systems, and data cleaning workflows using tools like Kafka and Spark.<br>
- **Data Analysis:** Uncovering insights through visualisations with Matplotlib, Plotly, and Tableau, as well as leveraging machine learning techniques (NLP, Fuzzy Matching, NER).<br>
- **Software Development:** Developing APIs, working with databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite), and following best practices in Python (OOP, TDD, Clean Code).<br>
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Deploying solutions on AWS (EC2, Lambda) and using Docker and Terraform to manage infrastructure.<br>

#### Professional Background:
I‚Äôm part of *Sigma Labs*, a team of high-performance technology consultants specialising in software, data, and platform engineering. Through their program, I‚Äôve developed my skills in:
- **Coding & Backend Development:** Flask, API development, database normalisation (3NF), and security fundamentals.<br>
- **Data Engineering & Processing:** Building pipelines, working with queues, and processing streams in real-time.<br>
- **Machine Learning:** Specialising in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other ML techniques to extract and match data.<br>
- **Agile Delivery:** Working individually and in agile teams, using problem-solving frameworks to deliver high-impact solutions.<br>

#### Key Tools & Technologies:
Python | PostgreSQL | Kafka | Spark<br>
Docker | AWS | Flask | Terraform<br>
‚ù§Ô∏è Matplotlib | Plotly | Streamlit | Tableau | Dash<br>

Feel free to explore my projects that reflect my passion for data-driven problem solving!
